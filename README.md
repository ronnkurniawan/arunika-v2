🎨 Arunika Studio — Front-End Playground

This is a personal project where I’m experimenting with Tailwind CSS and GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) inside a Vite setup.
It’s both a portfolio and a practice ground — a place where I can explore building smooth, responsive, scroll-based animations from scratch.

🧪 About This Project

This is my attempt to remake a website template originally built by Codegrid.
I’m not copying the code — I’m just recreating the layout and motion based on my own current understanding and skill level.

The goal isn’t perfection — the goal is learning.
